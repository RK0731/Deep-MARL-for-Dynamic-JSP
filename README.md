## Repository Overview

This repo includes the simulation model, learning algorithm and trained parameters. Those files can be identified by their prefix:
> 1. "Asset": asset on shop floor, such as machines;
> 2. "Brain": learning algorithm for job sequencing;
> 3. "Event": dynamic events on shop floor, such as job arrival;
> 4. "Main": actual simulation processes, to train, or validate deep MARL-based algorithms;
> 5. "Static": experiments on static problem instances.
